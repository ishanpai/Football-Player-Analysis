# Football-Striker-Analysis

This project aims to find strikers who are undervalued based on the difference between their goals scored and xG. The idea is that when a striker has outscored his xG by a lot, it is not just luck, but the striker has great finishing and is able to make the most of half-chances and chances. On the other hand, a striker who has underscored his xG by a lot, seems to not have finishing and misses chances consistently. Finishing, while not the only one, is a very important aspect of a striker's skill set and players with good finishing have the ability to change the game with a moment of brilliance while players with poor finishing are likely to miss big chances that come their way that could cost the team in big matches.

The analysis shows some of the best finishers in Europe today as well as some of the strikers who are relatively unknown who have performed very well. Here is a plot showing these players. This shows that Robert Lewandowski and Erling Haaland are the best strikers in the world which many would agree on. Many other well known players are in the list but it is interesting to see Luis Muriel, Morales, Domenico Berardi, Youssef En-Nesyri, Silas Wamangituka and other relatively less famous players high in this list. These players could be potentially good signings and will likely provide good value.
We have also normalized to see the results per 90 mins rather than over the whole season. We require a minimum condition of 5 goals (less now because we want to find players who didn't play that much). This brings forward certain players who may have been injured or haven't gotten to play consistently for some reason or the other. We are more likely to find some undervalued players here. We can see Ibrahima Niane has scored 6 goals in the 480 minutes he has played this season with Metz and outscores his xG by an average of 0.48 per game. Luis Muriel shows similar brilliance and having played 26 games, it is clear that he is an extremely clinical finisher. Some other interesting players to see here are Diogo Jota and Max Kruse who have played very few games but have been extremely good in them. Jota was injured for a large proportion of the season explaining his absence in the Liverpool squad. His quality finishing was severely missed for Liverpool especially considering the alternative is Firmino who shows up high in the list for the strikers with the worst finishing. This was also evident in his comeback to the team against Arsenal when he scored 2 goals.

We also see some of the worst finishers in Europe. This gives us a list of players who are not able to convert opportunities and would benefit from training on finishing. In this list notable players are Timo Werner, Kevin De Bruyne, Marco Reus, Roberto Firmino, Jamie Vardy, Neymar, and Sadio Mane. Looking purely from a goal scoring point of view, it seems like these players are overvalued by the market. Of course these players (especially the likes of KDB, Neymar, Reus) provide a lot more to the team in terms of creativity as can be seen by their very high xGChain and xGBuildup.

Another idea I had was to predict whether or not a young player will be 'successful'. We would have to begin by defining 'successful' and just an idea for this definition would be to be on the team of the season for their league for at least 3 years. Then we can have a list of paramters for every player that are accessible such as hieght, weight, speed (time for 100m sprint perhaps?), #goals, #assists, xG, xA, clean sheets, etc. This is now a classifciation problem. We would then train a neural network using data for many players when they were younger (say 18 perhaps) and then use that to predict whether current youngsters will be 'successful'. Other machine learning techniques such as k-nearest neighbours, etc should also be explored to find good accuracy.
