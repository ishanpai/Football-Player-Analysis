# Football-Striker-Analysis

This project aims to find strikers who are undervalued based on the difference between their goals scored and xG. The idea is that when a striker has outscored his xG by a lot, it is not just luck, but the striker has great finishing and is able to make the most of half-chances and chances. On the other hand, a striker who has underscored his xG by a lot, seems to not have finishing and misses chances consistently. Finishing, while not the only one, is a very important aspect of a striker's skill set and players with good finishing have the ability to change the game with a moment of brilliance while players with poor finishing are likely to miss big chances that come their way that could cost the team in big matches.

The analysis shows some of the best finishers in Europe today as well as some of the strikers who are relatively unknown who have performed very well. Here is a plot showing these players.
